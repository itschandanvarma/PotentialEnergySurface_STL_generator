# **LEPS Potential Energy Surface STL Generator**

This repository hosts a MATLAB script (`main.m`) that generates a 3D STL model (`PES.stl`) of the Potential Energy Surface (PES) for the F-H-H system using the LEPS model. Parameters are sourced from `PES and Dynamic Calculations.pdf`. Run the script in MATLAB to compute the PES and create an STL file for visualization or 3D printing. Below is a visualization of the generated STL model:
