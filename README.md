LEPS Potential Energy Surface STL Generator
This repository contains a MATLAB script (main.m) that generates a 3D STL model (PES.stl) of the Potential Energy Surface for the F-H-H system using the LEPS model, with parameters sourced from PES and Dynamic Calculations.pdf. Run the script in MATLAB to compute the PES and create the STL file for visualization or 3D printing. Below is a sample visualization of the generated STL model:
